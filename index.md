## Welcome to SEBASENet on Github

SEBASENet is the spanish Network of Excellence in Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE), which brings together the Spanish research groups working in SBSE.
Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) arises from the synergies between software engineering and other areas, such as optimization and search. Its main objective is the application of this type of techniques to the resolution of complex software engineering problems, offering the engineer better solutions to existing problems, while reducing the effort and cost required.

In this Github organization you will find links and  repositories for source code and datasets created by the members of SEBASENet.
