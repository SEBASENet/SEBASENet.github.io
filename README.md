## Welcome to SEBASENet on Github

SEBASENet is the spanish Network of Excellence in Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE), which brings together the Spanish research groups working in SBSE.
Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) arises from the synergies between software engineering and other areas, such as optimization and search. Its main objective is the application of this type of techniques to the resolution of complex software engineering problems, offering the engineer better solutions to existing problems, while reducing the effort and cost required.

In this Github organization you will find links and  repositories for source code and datasets created by the members of SEBASENet.
The offical SEBASENet web page is available [here](https://www.uco.es/investigacion/proyectos/SEBASENet/index.php?title=P%C3%A1gina_principal).

## Tools and services developed by SEBASENet members:

* [https://exemplar.us.es](EXEMPLAR): is a platform for the publication and tracking of experimental materials. It also integrates tools and allows the generation of descriptions of the experiments with the appropriate level of detail so that they can be replicated by other researchers.

* GAmera: is an open-source WS-BPEL mutation testing framework which uses genetic algorithms to reduce the number of mutants required.

* Rodan: is a test case generator for WS-BPEL 2.0 compositions. Rodan is based on mutation testing and genetic algorithms. Rodan generates test cases for killing mutants of the original WS-BPEL composition. The MuBPEL tool generates the mutants for the original composition.

* STATService: STATService is a web tool that helps users to apply statistical hypothesis testing easily, in accordance with the scientific methodology, the data distribution and the type of data to be analysed.
